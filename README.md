# Code for "Algorithmic Challenges in Ensuring Fairness at the Time of Decision"
Authors: Jad Salem, Swati Gupta, Vijay Kamble

## Set-up
This folder contains Python (.py) files, which should be run
with Python 3.8.0 or later. The following packages are used:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* datetime
* scipy
* sklearn.metrics
* random
* sys
* numdifftools
All files should be kept in the same folder.

## Usage
There are 5 figures in the paper that are generated by
simulations. These figures, and the files that generate
them, are listed below.
* Figure 5 (left): fig5-left.py
* Figure 5 (center): fig5-center.py
* Figure 5 (right): fig5-right.py
* Figure 6: fig6.py
* Figure 10: fig10.py

RevenueCurveFromData.py preprocesses online retail data, 
and __must be run before__ fig5-left.py and fig5-center.py.

AdaLGD.py contains an implementation of the AdaLGD algorithm
and is used as a subroutine of fig5-right.py.

The fanchart.py module is used in fig5-left.py and 
fig5-center.py.

The MyPriorityQueue.py module is used in the implementation
of SCAda-LGD in fig6.py.
